# BoneAge Prediction by Hand X-Rays

In this project, 2 training files exist. They can be used to train models via using hand X-rays or hand X-rays + gender information. For the models with 2 inputs (images, genders), concatenated models were used.

"test_all.py" can be run after downloading the models to evaluate the predictions of all models.
